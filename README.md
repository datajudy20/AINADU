### computer vision team project - face object recognition & automatic mosaic processing
 
1. Mosaic processing is possible for all faces recognized in the video  
2. the faces that have not been pretrained among the recognized faces are automatically mosaic-processed in real-time video  
3. Mosaic can be manually processed by clicking the mouse in the video
#

###### ***Pytorch, OpenCV and Ultra Fast Light Face Detector(https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB) has been used.***
###### ***final performed example video directory contains example videos demonstrating project results. Some of the team members appear in the video.***
#

* **0_final_front_face_train_1.py , 0_final_right_face_train_2.py , 0_final_left_face_train_3.py**  
: By executing each file, you can train a person's left, right, and front faces using a webcam.

* **0_final_3.py**  
: When you run this file, the face is recognized in the video, and the face that has not been trained in advance is automatically mosaiced.

* **auto_blur_video.py**  
: Mosaics everyone's faces in a given video. It also supports scene movement, pause and playback functions.
