### computer vision team project - face object recognition & automatic mosaic processing
 
1. Mosaic processing is possible for all faces recognized in the video  
2. the faces that have not been pretrained among the recognized faces are automatically mosaic-processed in real-time video  
3. Mosaic can be manually processed by clicking the mouse in the video
#
* **0_final_front_face_train_1.py , 0_final_right_face_train_2.py , 0_final_left_face_train_3.py**  
: By executing each file, you can train a person's front, right, and left faces using a webcam.

* **0_final_3.py**  
: the face is recognized in the video, and the face that has not been trained in advance is mosaiced automatically.

* **auto_blur_video.py**  
: Mosaics everyone's faces in a given video. It also supports scene movement, pause and playback functions.
